# Service Nervous System (SNS)

The Service Nervous System (SNS) framework is the Internet Computer's built-in solution for decentralized autonomous organizations (DAOs) to govern dapps. An SNS consists of an open, permissionless governance system and of a built-in governance token that is unique to each SNS. The SNS framework includes a process on how to launch a new SNS which includes raising initial funds for the DAO and decentralizing the DAOâ€™s voting power. Any dapp can be tokenized and decentralized by handing it over to a new SNS DAO.
