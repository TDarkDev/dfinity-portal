# Python

<MarkdownChipRow labels={["Beginner", "Python" ]} />

Python is a general-purpose, high-level programming language that is designed for widespread flexibility, functionality, and increased code readability. It supports structured, functional, and object-orientated programming.

To develop Python smart contracts on ICP, the canister development kit (CDK) known as [Kybra](https://demergent-labs.github.io/kybra/kybra.html) can be used.

Kybra is designed as a fully comprehensive Python environment for ICP canisters. It supports as many relevant environment APIs as possible.

Kybra allows developers to bring their existing Python skills and workflows to ICP, such as using pip packages.

:::caution
Kybra is a community contributed project and is not maintained by DFINITY. Kybra is developed by [Demergent Labs](https://github.com/demergent-labs), a for-profit company that receives a grant from DFINITY for development of Kybra.
