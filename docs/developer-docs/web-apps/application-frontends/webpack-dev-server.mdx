# Using webpack-dev-server

<MarkdownChipRow labels={["Intermediate", "Tutorial"]} />

## Overview 

Starting with `dfx 0.7.7`, the SDK now provides you with webpack-dev-server in the `dfx new` starter.

The webpack development server, `webpack-dev-server`, provides in-memory access to the webpack assets, enabling you to
make changes and see them reflected in the browser right away using live reloading.

### Step 1: Create a new project and change to your project directory.

### Step 2: Start the replica locally, if necessary, with the `dfx start --clean --background` command.
Then, deploy your dapp as you normally would, for example, by running the `dfx deploy` command.

### Step 3: Start the webpack development server by running the following command:

       npm start

### Step 4: Open a web browser and navigate to the asset canister for your application using port 8080.

   For example:

       http://localhost:8080

### Step 5: Open a new terminal window or tab and navigate to your project directory.

### Step 6: Open the `src/hello_frontend/src/index.js` file for your project in a text editor and make changes to the content.

   For example, you might add an element to the page using JavaScript:

   document.body.onload = addElement;

       document.body.onload = addElement;

       function addElement () {
         // create a new div element
         const newDiv = document.createElement("div");

         // and give it some content
         const newContent = document.createTextNode("Test live page reloading!");

         // add the text node to the newly created div
         newDiv.appendChild(newContent);

         // add the newly created element and its content into the DOM
         const currentDiv = document.getElementById("div1");
         document.body.insertBefore(newDiv, currentDiv);
       }

### Step 7: Save your changes to the `index.js` file but leave the editor open to continue making changes.

### Step 8: Refresh the browser or wait for it to refresh on its own to see your change.

   When you are done working on the frontend for your project, you can stop the webpack development server by pressing
   Control-C.
