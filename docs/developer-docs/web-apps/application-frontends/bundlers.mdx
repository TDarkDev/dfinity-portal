# Using bundlers

<MarkdownChipRow labels={["Intermediate", "Concept"]} />

## Overview

Webpack is a popular and highly-configurable module bundler for JavaScript-based applications, new projects created with `dfx new` that choose to create a default JavaScript frontend include a default `webpack.config.js` file that makes it easy to add the specific modules, such as `react` and `markdown`, that you want to use.

## Entry and output configuration

In many cases, you can use the default `webpack.config.js` file as-is, without any modification, or you can add
plug-ins, modules, and other custom configurations to suit your needs. The specific changes you make to
the `webpack.config.js` configuration largely depend on the other tools and frameworks you want to use.

For example, if you have experimented with the [customizing the frontend](custom-frontend)
or [adding a stylesheet](add-stylesheet) frontend tutorials, you might have modified the following section to work with React
JavaScript:

```
        module: {
          rules: [
            { test: /\.(ts|tsx|jsx)$/, loader: "ts-loader" },
            { test: /\.css$/, use: ['style-loader','css-loader'] }
          ]
        }
      };
    }
```

If your application does not use `dfx` to run your build script, you can provide the variables yourself. For example:

    DFX_NETWORK=ic NODE_ENV=production HELLO_CANISTER_ID=rrkah... npm run build

### Ensuring node.js is available in a project

Because projects rely on webpack to provide the framework for the default frontend, you must have `node.js` installed in
your development environment and accessible in the project directory.

- If you want to develop your project without using the default webpack configuration and canister aliases, you can
  remove the `frontend` canister from the `dfx.json` file or build your project using a specific canister name. For
  example, you can choose to build only the hello program without frontend assets by running the following command:

      dfx build hello_backend

- If you are using the default webpack configuration and running `dfx build` fails, you should try running `npm install`
  in the project directory then re-running `dfx build`.

- If running `npm install` in the project directory doesnâ€™t fix the issue, you should check the configuration of
  the `webpack.config.js` file for syntax errors.

## Using other bundlers

You may want to use a bundler other than webpack. Per-bundler instructions are not ready yet, but if you are familiar
with your bundler, the following steps should get you going:

- #### Step 1: Remove the `copy:types`, `prestart`, and `prebuild` scripts from `package.json`.

- #### Step 2: Run `dfx deploy` to generate the local bindings for your canisters.

- #### Step 3: Copy the generated bindings to a directory where you would like to keep them.

- #### Step 4: Modify `declarations/<canister_name>/index.js` and replace `process.env.<CANISTER_NAME>_CANISTER_ID` with the equivalent pattern for environment variables for your bundler.

    - Alternately hardcode the canister ID if that is your preferred workflow

- #### Step 5: Commit the declarations and import them in your codebase.

## Deploying a frontend canister without building frontend dependencies 

If you'd like to deploy a frontend asset canister without building the node or npm dependency packages, you can manually download the Wasm module dfx uses for its default frontend canister and install the canister manually.

- #### Step 1: Download the frontend asset canister's Wasm module.

```
wget https://github.com/dfinity/sdk/raw/0.15.2/src/distributed/assetstorage.wasm.gzand
```

- #### Step 2: Install the canister.

```
dfx canister install <id instead of name> --wasm assetstorage.wasm.gz
```

Using the canister ID, the canister will not sync automatically. If you want the canister to sync according to the configuration in `dfx.json`, then use the canister name instead of the canister ID:

```
dfx canister install frontend_canister --wasm assetstorage.wasm.gz
```

To sync assets to the canister manually, you can use `icx-asset sync`, but this package must be installed with Rust, `cargo install icx-asset`.
