## What is decentralized AI?

Decentralized artificial intelligence (DeAI or decentralized AI) is a form of AI and machine learning that utilizes blockchain technologies and decentralized protocols such as ICP. ICP enables truly decentralized AI by running services on-chain, providing a permissionless and secure way to run machine learning applications. 

Canisters can be used to host AI services and run machine learning algorithms using popular AI/ML frameworks and libraries. HTTPS outcalls can be used to make API calls to external AI APIs like OpenAI.

## ICP AI projects

Several community projects that showcase how to use AI on ICP are available:

- [ArcMind AI](https://github.com/arcmindai/arcmindai): An autonomous agent using Chain of Thoughts for reasoning and actions. Try the [app in-browser](https://arcmindai.app).

- [ArcMind Vector DB](https://github.com/arcmindai/arcmindvector): A vector database that supports text, image, and audio embedding.

- [DeVinci](https://github.com/patnorris/DecentralizedAIonIC): An AI chatbot that uses an open-source LLM. [Check out the canister yourself](https://x6occ-biaaa-aaaai-acqzq-cai.icp0.io/).

- [ICGPT](https://github.com/icppWorld/icgpt): A React frontend that uses a C/C++ backend running an LLM fully on-chain. [Check it out yourself](https://icgpt.icpp.world/).

- [ic-mnist](https://github.com/smallstepman/ic-mnist): A sort of machine learning 'Hello, world!' running on ICP. [Try it here](https://jsi2g-jyaaa-aaaam-abnia-cai.icp0.io/).

- [ELNA AI](https://github.com/elna-ai): A fully on-chain AI agent platform and marketplace. Supports both on-chain and off-chain LLMs. [Try it here](https://dapp.elna.ai/).

- [Tensorflow on ICP](https://github.com/carlosarturoceron/decentAI): An Azle example that uses a pre-trained model for making predictions.

- [MotokoLearn](https://github.com/ildefons/motokolearn): A Motoko package that enables on-chain machine learning.

- [Tract-IC-AI](https://github.com/jeshli/tract-ic-ai): An ICP variations of Tract. 

- [Rust-Connect-Py-AI-to-IC](https://github.com/jeshli/rust-connect-py-ai-to-ic): Open-source tool for deploying Python AI models.

- [Juno + OpenAI](https://github.com/peterpeterparker/juno-openai): An example using Juno and OpenAI to generate images from prompts.

## Technical working group: DeAI

A technical working group dedicated to discussing decentralized AI and related projects meets bi-weekly on Thursdays at 5pm UTC. You can join via the [community Discord server](https://discord.gg/QnV6TNgV).

You can learn more about the group, review the notes from previous meetings, and ask questions on the [DFINITY forum](https://forum.dfinity.org/t/technical-working-group-deai/24621).
